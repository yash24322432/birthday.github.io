That was the moment I saw you for the first time, and from that very day, you became my world. That first glance, the nervous excitement, the rapid heartbeat‚Äîit all still feels as fresh as if it happened just yesterday. Meeting you was the most beautiful moment of my life, and every day since then feels incomplete without you.You are my Lehar‚Äîthe one who touches every corner of my heart, who brings both peace and a sweet restlessness into my life, the kind that comes with the fear of ever losing you. You are the reason behind my smile, the one I think of in every prayer.I just want your life to always be filled with love and happiness. May every day bring you what you truly deserve, and may every path be easy for you. No matter what happens, I will always be with you‚Äîin every smile, every tear, every dream, and every new beginning.",
